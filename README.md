# ArtiStats
web application that allows you to see stats about artists and their songs.

### Requirements
ArtiStats uses Laravel 8, PHP 7 & Bootstrap 4. The project does not require a data base since it's only using APIs to fetch data.

### Features
Get information about an artist, the number of albums they made, what's their oldest song, what is the most used word in their songs and more!
